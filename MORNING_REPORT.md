# STATUS — continue here (updated 2026-06-14)

Entry point for picking the project back up (incl. a fresh conversation).

## Where we are

- **DESIGN.md is the source of truth** (architecture D1–D7, topology §2 + §2.1, the D4 settings preset, the RPC contract §5, spike findings §8, the UI rounds §12, and the **consolidated open backlog §13**). Read it first.
- **Phases:** Phase 1 (plumbing) ✅, Phase 2 (sheet + HP) ✅, Phase 3 combat loop ✅ (Route B two-tap item use, live targeting, move pad, Turn HUD). Plus 7 rounds of L&F/feature polish (§12).
- **Spikes 2 & 3 passed** (Route A dead → Route B; two-tap player-rolls via held workflow). Spikes 4 (sense/latency), 5 (full iOS), 6 (TV reticles) still owed.
- The module is junction-linked into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FoundryVTT\Data\modules\mobile-command`; edits are JS/CSS so a **hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)** of the client loads them (manifest changes need a full Foundry app restart). Test world: **"Offline test"** (Restored Keep). Phone client = a non-GM browser logged in as a player; the module forces `core.noCanvas` for phone clients.

## How to test the combat loop (two clients)

DM/app = the executor (GM, on the active scene, unpaused). One browser window = a player (Fighter/Wizard owner). Actions tab → pick an action → pick target(s) (reticle commits on the DM) → Use → Roll damage. Saves/reactions fan to the target owner's phone. Rests/rolls open dialogs that render as full-height bottom-sheets on the phone.

## What's been confirmed working (DM-tested)

Shell + sheet, HP/temp tap-edit (±/Set), AC, inspiration, the two-tap attack→damage loop, live target preview, move pad, the dark-fantasy L&F. DM quote: "looks and acts GREAT, huge improvement."

## Untested by CC (no live client here) — verify on reload

UI rounds 3–7 broadly; Details skills/tools list; rests; Turn HUD/End turn; the bottom-sheet dialog restyle (rest/attack/reactions); reactions actually fanning to the phone.

## What to do next

**AoE push (§11) — ✅ VERIFIED LIVE 2026-06-16** ("everything worked as expected"): phone announces → DM panel "Place" → template → auto-target → damage → saves → template auto-clears. Also live: the owned-token switcher and the "This is the TV" display-role button + TV combat-HUD suppression.

**Save/reaction prompt surface — ✅ BUILT (Round 17, 2026-06-16, UNTESTED).** The executor relays midi's `preTargetSave` to the target's phone (`registerSaveRelay` in rpc.js); the phone shows a tappable "⚡ <spell> — Roll DEX (DC X)" card (`#savePromptHTML`/`noteSavePrompt`) that fires the native (Restyled) save roll midi intercepts (Spike 3). Auto-clears after `playerSaveTimeout`. Fixes the gap the DM hit live (the whispered save card is hidden behind the shell). **Verify:** the card appears when an AoE/single-target save hits a phone player, the tap rolls + midi counts it (no double-roll), and the auto-clear timing. Ability saves only for now (reactions are the next use of the same relay).

**Module eval (Round 17):** Bugbear's Scripts (`thatlonelybugbear/bugs`) — recommended **not** adding (Foundry-14 unverified, redundant with automated-conditions-5e, orthogonal to the phone use case). See §12 Round 17.

**Next:** long-press detail suite, real inventory/Equipment, TV reticles (§6/§7.3), or extend the save relay to reactions. Pacing: focused increment → DM tests live → iterate → commit.

## House rules (from CLAUDE.md)

Pinned stack: Foundry 14.363 · dnd5e 5.3.3 · midi-qol 14.0.8. Tests = numbered expected results, one at a time, stop on first failure. Write only in the test world; never delete. New findings → DESIGN.md, dated.
